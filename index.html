The ride itself is located in the Hogwarts castle! It\'s is extremely immersive and one of my favorites in the Islands of Adventure section of the park. It takes you on a journey where you get to experience a Hogwarts quidditch match as a muggle. You are accompanied by some iconic characters such as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy & more! This ride is extremely nostalgic for me and helps me live my childhood dream of experiencing the wizarding world. '],

The line leading up to the ride takes you through the Hogwarts castle! You walk through iconic places from the movies such as the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, the Herbology greenhouse and the entrance to the Gryffindor common room!  (My favorite part is the Express Pass line because it takes you up a hidden staircase in the castle which you do not get to experience in the normal queue). Make sure you do not skip this ride! It is an amazing adventure through the wizarding world.'],

This ride is one of my all time favorites. Although I have never seen The Mummy film franchise, this ride captures the essence of it perfectly. It is great for lovers of the movie franchise but also for typical park guests looking for a good thrill! My favorite thing to do is pose for the camera towards the end of the ride and go to the gift shop to see the photo. After that I end up running back to the entrance and riding again while doing a different pose for the next photo. I highly recommend you do the same thing! It really enhances the experience.'],

Although I have been on this ride numerous times, the creepy music and lighting of the queue will never fail to make me nervous and get a boost of adrenaline. Revenge of the Mummy is one of the older rides in the park but it is seriously such a classic! Every time I visit Universal Studios I make sure to go on this ride at least 10 times. This is by far my favorite ride on Universal property so if you are visiting Universal, make sure to check it out!'],

I love thrill rides and in my opinion this is the best thrill ride in the park. Whenever I arrive at Universal this is my first stop. I love to start off my day with an intense ride because then my adrenaline is pumping and I’m ready to take on the day. My favorite part about this ride is picking the music that plays in the speakers of your seat. If you ride this ride I recommend either “Glamorous” by Fergie or “Pump It” by the Black Eyed Peas.'],

I love a good roller coaster and I think this is in my top 3 on Universal property! The queue is also super immersive and perfectly sets the tone of the ride! You definitely do not have to enjoy superheroes to enjoy this ride! The coaster is super fun even without knowing much about the Hulk!'],

The ride accelerates and launches you out into a twist while the Hulk roars. This coaster is super smooth and the drops are “incredible”! Get it?! Anyway… At one point the coaster dips and goes right over the water. The cool mist hits you and it is such a cool experience! Every time I go to Universal I get so excited to see the green structure of the ride because it is such an iconic attraction! I highly recommend getting front row if it is possible! I feel like front row experience makes it so much better!'],

You do not need a ticket to get into it so it is a great option if you do not want to spend money one day on your vacation but you still want a fun experience! Citywalk is also open much later than the actual theme parks so it is fun to stop in after a long day at the park and shop and eat some great food with fun night life and scenery!'],

There are options for everyone! My personal favorite is the Hard Rock Cafe because it is such a cool location and the food is amazing! My favorite store on Citywalk is the Universal Studios Store! The reason I love this store so much is because it sells all of the merchandise that you can find within the park! This is great because when I am exploring in the park throughout the day I refrain from purchasing anything because I do not want to carry it around. When I see something I like during the day I remember to pick it up on my way out at the Universal store later that night! This makes it way more convenient and less stressful. '],

My favorite food to get from this restaurant is the fish & chips! I also really enjoy their American Breakfast. If you are not visiting the Universal Studios side of the park you can visit the sister restaurant called the Three Broomsticks in Islands of Adventure!

If you are a Harry Potter fan and you are visiting Universal Studios, this is definitely a must see! You will leave feeling nostalgic and satisfied. Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan, this is a great restaurant option because it has a different menu than most of the typical theme park food.
